// 465  Optimal Account Balancing #Uber
// A group of friends went on holiday and sometimes lent each other money. For example, Alice paid for Bill's lunch for $10. Then later Chris gave Alice $5 for a taxi ride. We can model each transaction as a tuple (x, y, z) which means person x gave person y $z. Assuming Alice, Bill, and Chris are person 0, 1, and 2 respectively (0, 1, 2 are the person's ID), the transactions can be represented as [[0, 1, 10], [2, 0, 5]].
// Given a list of transactions between a group of people, return the minimum number of transactions required to settle the debt.
// Note:
// A transaction will be given as a tuple (x, y, z). Note that x â‰  y and z > 0.
// Person's IDs may not be linear, e.g. we could have the persons 0, 1, 2 or we could also have the persons 0, 2, 6

//Solution: With all the given transactions, in the end, each person with ID = id will have an overall balance bal[id].
// Note that the id value or any person coincidentally with 0 balance is irrelevant to debt settling count, so we can
// simply use an array debt[] to store all non-zero balances, where
// debt[i] > 0 means a person needs to pay $ debt[i] to other person(s);
// debt[i] < 0 means a person needs to collect $ debt[i] back from other person(s).
// Starting from first debt debt[0], we look for all other debts debt[i] (i>0) which have opposite sign to debt[0].
// Then each such debt[i] can make one transaction debt[i] += debt[0] to clear the person with debt debt[0]. From now
// on, the person with debt debt[0] is dropped out of the problem and we recursively drop persons one by one until everyone's
// debt is cleared meanwhile updating the minimum number of transactions during DFS.
